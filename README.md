# ECG-Signal-Processing
This project focuses on the simulation and acquisition of ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals using LTSpice. It includes the generation of realistic ECG waveforms, introduction of common noise sources (e.g., 50/60 Hz interference, baseline wander), and the design of amplification and filtering circuits for clean signal processing.
